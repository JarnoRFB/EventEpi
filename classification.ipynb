Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever.',\n",

Typhi.Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone-resistant S. Typhi have been reported in several countries.',\n",
       " 'However, this is the first time a large outbreak caused by XDR S. Typhi has been observed in Pakistan.The risk at regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread over-use of anti-microbials which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region.Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices.',\n",
       " 'However, S. Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated.',\n",
       " 'The high level of resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all three levels.WHO recommendationsThis outbreak highlights the importance of public health measures to prevent the spread of resistant and non-resistant pathogens.',\n",
       " 'While the emerging resistance in S. Typhi complicates treatment, typhoid fever remains common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water.',\n",
       " 'Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are the main and most important recommendations.WHO recommends typhoid vaccination in response to confirmed outbreaks of typhoid fever, and travelers to typhoid-endemic areas should consider vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Further, where the TCV is licensed, WHO recommends TCV as the preferred typhoid vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Typhoid vaccination should be implemented in combination with other efforts to control the disease.In view of the observed capacity for S. Typhi to quickly acquire new resistance mechanisms, WHO recommends strengthening surveillance of typhoid fever, including surveillance of AMR to monitor known resistance, detect new and emerging resistance, and mitigate its spread.',\n",
       " 'WHO also recommends that surveillance data is shared locally and internationally in a timely manner.Currently, azithromycin is the only remaining reliable and affordable first-line oral therapeutic option to manage patients with XDR typhoid in low-resource settings.',\n",
       " 'Patients with suspected typhoid fever should be tested microbiologically to detect S. Typhi and define antimicrobial susceptibility wherever possible to inform patient management and contribute to the surveillance efforts.',\n",
